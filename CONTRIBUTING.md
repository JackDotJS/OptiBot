# Contributing Guidelines
Here you'll find some very basic rules that if followed, will make development on this bot a lot more streamlined.

1. First and foremost, don't push massive amounts of work in a single commit. Work on bits a pieces at a time, and commit them separately.
    * This helps with keeping track of what new features were added or changed, as well as helping to find bugs if they appear.
2. Make sure your commit messages are clear and concise.
    * For example: **do** `jarfix: updated the link` and **don't** `someBODY once TOLD ME`
3. If there is a massive and breaking change, **don't commit it to master.** Instead, create a new branch with the new change and open a PR.
    * This is so that we're all aware of what the change is and we can update our own codebases accordingly
